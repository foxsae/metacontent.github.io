All of my investments are long-term investments. I invest in ETF's
because they are safer than individual stocks, but I also invest in
cryptocurrencies because I believe that they are the future of
finance. It's only a matter of time until some form of crypto becomes the dominant financial system.

**Which ETF's**

As a Canadian, it is slightly more complicated and less
profitable to invest in US Markets due to conversion rates as well as
potential tax issues, so I invest in
[ZCN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZCN.TO?p=ZCN.TO&.tsrc=fin-srch)
which is an ETF of the top 230 Canadian Stocks, and
[XBB](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XBB.TO?p=XBB.TO&.tsrc=fin-srch)
which is a Bond ETF that holds approximately 1300 different types of Canadian bonds.

**Which Crypto**

My primary crypto investment is
[CRO](https://crypto.com). If you are
interested in using the Crypto.com App [we will both be rewarded
with $25](https://crypto.com/app/g8ygkmbn48) if you use my referral
code: `g8ygkmbn48`

If you plan to trade on the [Crypto.com/exchange](https://crypto.com/exchange) then you can also use
my referral code for that `g8ygkmbn48` and we will both be rewarded with up to
$50. You even have up to 10 days after creating your trading account to use my referral code.

**Why Crypto.com**

If you are one to believe that promotion
drives the market then two good reasons to invest with Crypto.com are:
First, they recently took over the name of a famous Los
Angeles arena which as of Dec 25th 2021 is now known as [The Crypto.com
Arena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto.com_Arena). This arena is home to the Los Angeles Kings NHL team, as well
as the LA Lakers and LA Clippers NBA teams. The naming contract is
scheduled to last for the next 20 years. Second, they recently produced a
commercial starring Matt Damon as their new brand ambassador entitled
"Fortune Favors the Brave" which is linked below.

However, If you are not one to be convinced by promotion and would
rather see solid functionality then consider
that Crypto.com owns the second most active cryptocurrency exchange
based on total volume, and let's not forget the Crypto.com Visa Card
which is the most popular Visa card of its type in the world.

**Why Cryptocurrency**

Under the current financial system, governments can print money any
time they want, rather than solve the problem this only
inflates costs for everyone. Being able to do that allows the government to act
irresponsibly since they do not need to care about how they spend taxpayers money because they know they can just print more if they run
out. This enables them to essentially campaign on nothing more than a
platform of bribery to get elected. This isn't good.

When the government resorts to printing money to pay off its debts, and
its voters, then prices rise (duh!) and the majority of that printed money ends up in the hands of those who need
it the least (oops!).

A decentralized cryptocurrency means that no one can
simply print more whenever they need it. A cryptocurrency with a public blockchain means
that there is a record of every transaction that has ever been made,
unlike cash which can be completely anonymous. This means that
cryptocurrencies are more stable, more reliable, more accountable, and
even dare I say it more ethical than the traditional fiat currency systems
in use today.

Yes, crypto still has a long way to go before it supplants traditional
systems, but given the current economic instability and the way that
governments have recently ramped up their attempts to print their way
out of any crisis, I believe a global transition to crypto could happen a lot sooner
than people think.
