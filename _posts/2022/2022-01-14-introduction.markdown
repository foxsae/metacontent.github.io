It's been said that a good first post for any blog is a description of
the purposes and reasons behind said blog. It's also a good thing to
introduce yourself and say hello. Well, Hello. Now, as far as the rest goes...

The reasons for this blog are mostly just to record various things
which I do with my computer, a place to keep notes and jot things
down. What sort of things? Well I've been learning [Common
Lisp](https://common-lisp.net/) lately and I might have a thing or two to say about that at some point. I've
also noodled around with Python for a bit so I wouldn't be surprised
if that also came up.

I mostly use Ubuntu Linux as my desktop, though at the moment I'm on
Windows 11, using the WSL ([Windows Subsystem for
Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)) which is
kind of a bastardized version of Linux lurking inside a windows wraper.

I've had a long time interest in [crypto currency](https://crypto.com/), and to a lesser
extent stocks. I plan to disclose where I'm currently investing on the
[Investing page]({% link investing.markdown %}), if anyone is curious.

I also feel quite strongly about [Free Software and Open
Software](https://opensource.com/), the megolith corporations that
have produced mountains of closed software over the past 50 years have
done a major disservice to the entire planet not just the software industry.

So, that's what this will be about, and that's what I'm about.
