It's been said that a good first post for any blog is a description of
the purposes and reasons behind the blog. It's also a good thing to
introduce yourself and say hello. While this is by no means a good
first post, it is the first post and so introductions are in order.

Well, Hello.

**The How**

Regarding the blog system it's hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and uses
[giscus](https://giscus.app/) for commenting. Basically, its just a simple static site generated
with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

I will not be doing any sort of SEO optimization, or tracking, there
are no cookies, or analytics, and no newsletter. The only thing required is a Github
account, and you only need to have that if you wish to leave me a
comment on one of my posts.
You should see the comment box *(say hello!)* which giscus provides at
the bottom of this post, it hooks into the discussion section of a
Github repository, which I must say, is pretty clever, but that's why you
need a Github account to make a comment.

There should be an RSS feed somewhere on the main page if you wish to
subscribe, I plan to post about weekly.

**The Why**

The reasons for the existence of `the metacontent blog` are mostly just to record various things
which I do with my computer, a place to keep notes and jot things
down. What sort of things? Well, I've been hacking around with [Common
Lisp](https://common-lisp.net/) lately and I might have a thing or two to say about that at some point. I've
also noodled around with Python and Java in the past so I wouldn't be surprised
if that also came up.

I mostly use Ubuntu Linux as my desktop, though at the moment I'm on
Windows 11, using the WSL ([Windows Subsystem for
Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)) which is
kind of a bastardized version of Linux lurking inside a Windows wrapper.

I've had a long-time interest in [cryptocurrency](https://crypto.com/) and to a lesser
extent stocks. I plan to disclose which products I'm currently
invested with on the
[Investing]({% link investing.markdown %}) tab if anyone is curious.

I also feel quite strongly about [Free Software and Open
Software](https://opensource.com/), the megalith corporations that
have produced mountains of closed software over the past 50 years have
done a major disservice to the entire planet, not just the software industry.

So, I guess, that's what this will be about, but I suppose time will
tell.

Oh, and I might post pictures of my dog.
